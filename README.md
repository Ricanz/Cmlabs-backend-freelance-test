For freelance testing purpose
I am making 2 logic 
> Fizzbuzz & Palindrome Word


## FizzBuzz
I need to print a loop number from 1 to 100,
if the number is multiple of 3 then print "Fizz",
if the number is multiple of 5 then print "Buzz",
if the number is multiple of both 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz",
else i just need to print the number

## Palindrome
Palindromes are words that form the same when reversed.
I need to make this Palindrome function and need to return true if the words are palindrome and print false if its not
